                           Abstract
                           The mitotic (or spindle assembly) checkpoint system delays anaphase until all chromosomes are correctly attached to the mitotic
                              spindle. When the checkpoint is active, a Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC) assembles and inhibits the ubiquitin ligase Anaphase-Promoting
                              Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). MCC is composed of the checkpoint proteins Mad2, BubR1, and Bub3 associated with the APC/C activator
                              Cdc20. When the checkpoint signal is turned off, MCC is disassembled and the checkpoint is inactivated. The mechanisms of
                              the disassembly of MCC are not sufficiently understood. We have previously observed that ATP hydrolysis is required for the
                              action of the Mad2-binding protein p31comet to disassemble MCC. We now show that HeLa cell extracts contain a factor that promotes ATP- and p31comet-dependent disassembly of a Cdc20–Mad2 subcomplex and identify it as Thyroid Receptor Interacting Protein 13 (TRIP13), an
                              AAA-ATPase known to interact with p31comet. The joint action of TRIP13 and p31comet also promotes the release of Mad2 from MCC, participates in the complete disassembly of MCC and abrogates checkpoint inhibition
                              of APC/C. We propose that TRIP13 plays centrally important roles in the sequence of events leading to MCC disassembly and
                              checkpoint inactivation.

                           Abstract
                           The mucus that covers and protects the epithelium of the intestine is built around its major structural component, the gel-forming
                              MUC2 mucin. The gel-forming mucins have traditionally been assumed to be secreted as nonattached. The colon has a two-layered
                              mucus system where the inner mucus is attached to the epithelium, whereas the small intestine normally has a nonattached mucus.
                              However, the mucus of the small intestine of meprin β-deficient mice was now found to be attached. Meprin β is an endogenous
                              zinc-dependent metalloprotease now shown to cleave the N-terminal region of the MUC2 mucin at two specific sites. When recombinant
                              meprin β was added to the attached mucus of meprin β-deficient mice, the mucus was detached from the epithelium. Similar to
                              meprin β-deficient mice, germ-free mice have attached mucus as they did not shed the membrane-anchored meprin β into the luminal
                              mucus. The ileal mucus of cystic fibrosis (CF) mice with a nonfunctional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
                              (CFTR) channel was recently shown to be attached to the epithelium. Addition of recombinant meprin β to CF mucus did not release
                              the mucus, but further addition of bicarbonate rendered the CF mucus normal, suggesting that MUC2 unfolding exposed the meprin
                              β cleavage sites. Mucus is thus secreted attached to the goblet cells and requires an enzyme, meprin β in the small intestine,
                              to be detached and released into the intestinal lumen. This process regulates mucus properties, can be triggered by bacterial
                              contact, and is nonfunctional in CF due to poor mucin unfolding.

                           Abstract
                           Unconventional myosin 15 is a molecular motor expressed in inner ear hair cells that transports protein cargos within developing
                              mechanosensory stereocilia. Mutations of myosin 15 cause profound hearing loss in humans and mice; however, the properties
                              of this motor and its regulation within the stereocilia organelle are unknown. To address these questions, we expressed a
                              subfragment 1-like (S1) truncation of mouse myosin 15, comprising the predicted motor domain plus three light-chain binding
                              sites. Following unsuccessful attempts to express functional myosin 15-S1 using the Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9)-baculovirus system, we discovered that coexpression of the muscle-myosin–specific chaperone UNC45B, in addition to
                              the chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) significantly increased the yield of functional protein. Surprisingly, myosin
                              15-S1 did not bind calmodulin with high affinity. Instead, the IQ domains bound essential and regulatory light chains that
                              are normally associated with class II myosins. We show that myosin 15-S1 is a barbed-end–directed motor that moves actin filaments
                              in a gliding assay (∼430 nm·s−1 at 30 °C), using a power stroke of 7.9 nm. The maximum ATPase rate (kcat ∼6 s−1) was similar to the actin-detachment rate (kdet = 6.2 s−1) determined in single molecule optical trapping experiments, indicating that myosin 15-S1 was rate limited by transit through
                              strongly actin-bound states, similar to other processive myosin motors. Our data further indicate that in addition to folding
                              muscle myosin, UNC45B facilitates maturation of an unconventional myosin. We speculate that chaperone coexpression may be
                              a simple method to optimize the purification of other myosin motors from Sf9 insect cells.

                           Abstract
                           
                           Cellular adhesions are modulated by cytoskeletal forces or external stresses and adapt to the mechanical properties of the
                              extracellular matrix. We propose that this mechanosensitivity can be driven at least in part by the elastic, cell-contractility-induced
                              deformations of protein molecules that form the adhesion. The model accounts for observations of anisotropic growth and shrinkage
                              of focal adhesions in the direction of the force and predicts that focal adhesions only grow within a range of force that
                              is determined by the composition and matrix properties. This prediction is consistent with the observations of a force threshold
                              for the appearance of elongated focal adhesions and the disruption of adhesions into fibrils on a mobile extracellular matrix.
                              The growth dynamics is calculated and the predicted sliding of focal adhesions is consistent with several experiments.

                           Extracts of wheat germ are capable of synthesizing the major capsid protein of simian virus 40. Poly(A)-containing RNA from
                              BS-C-1 cells infected with simian virus 40 directed the synthesis of a novel polypeptide that migrates in polyacrylamide gels
                              together with the major capsid polypeptide of simian virus 40, VP-1. The patterns of the major tryptic peptides of purified
                              VP-1 and the novel polypeptide synthesized in vitro were identical after two-dimensional paper electrophoresis. The novel polypeptide was not synthesized in response to poly(A)-rich
                              RNA from uninfected cells or from virus-infected cells treated with cytosine arabinoside. Messenger RNA from infected cells
                              purified by selective hybridization to DNA of simian virus 40 directs the synthesis of a major polypeptide of electrophoretic
                              mobility similar to that of VP-1 of simian virus 40. This approach should prove useful in identifying additional products

                           Abstract
                           Heart wall myofibers wind as helices around the ventricles, strengthening them in a manner analogous to the reinforcement
                              of concrete cylindrical columns by spiral steel cables [Richart FE, et al. (1929) Univ of Illinois, Eng Exp Stn Bull 190].
                              A multitude of such fibers, arranged smoothly and regularly, contract and relax as an integrated functional unit as the heart
                              beats. To orchestrate this motion, fiber tangling must be avoided and pumping should be efficient. Current models of myofiber
                              orientation across the heart wall suggest groupings into sheets or bands, but the precise geometry of bundles of myofibers
                              is unknown. Here we show that this arrangement takes the form of a special minimal surface, the generalized helicoid [Blair
                              DE, Vanstone JR (1978) Minimal Submanifolds and Geodesics 13–16], closing the gap between individual myofibers and their collective wall structure. The model holds across species,
                              with a smooth variation in its three curvature parameters within the myocardial wall providing tight fits to diffusion magnetic
                              resonance images from the rat, the dog, and the human. Mathematically it explains how myofibers are bundled in the heart wall
                              while economizing fiber length and optimizing ventricular ejection volume as they contract. The generalized helicoid provides
                              a unique foundation for analyzing the fibrous composite of the heart wall and should therefore find applications in heart
                              tissue engineering and in the study of heart muscle diseases.

                           Abstract
                           Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without
                              their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and
                              negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting
                              moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional
                              contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News
                              Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative
                              expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook
                              influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work
                              also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary
                              for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.

                              negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting
                              moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional
                              contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News
                              Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative
                              expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook
                              influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work
                              also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary
                              for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.
